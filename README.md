### Espresso Demo Project
* Simple number counter app to demonstrate the capabilities of Espresso
* Increment button increases number value, and decrement button decreases it
* ```I'm Ready``` button allows user to advance to next activity to demonstrate ```ScrollView``` capabilities
* Accompanying slide deck is available [here](https://github.com/jerielng/presentations/blob/master/Android%20UI%20Automation%20with%20Espresso.pdf)

## Notes
* Separate branch ```ui-feature-branch``` is available to demonstrate breaking changes to Espresso tests and should not be amended
